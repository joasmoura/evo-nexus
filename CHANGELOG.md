The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Core routines documentation** (`docs/routines/core-routines.md`) — detailed explanation of all 5 core routines: what they do, why they matter, and how they form the daily loop
- **Memory Lint promoted to core** — moved from `ADWs/routines/custom/` to `ADWs/routines/`, hardcoded in `scheduler.py` (Sunday 09:00). Now 5 core routines instead of 4
- **Release skill** now syncs screenshots (`public/print-*.png` → `site/public/assets/`) on every release

### Changed
- **Dashboard pages redesigned** — 12 pages (Audit, Config, Costs, Files, Integrations, Memory, Reports, Roles, Routines, Scheduler, Skills, Systems, Templates, Users) with consistent dark theme and improved UX
- **Integration count** — 19 → 17 (removed internal-only Licensing and WhatsApp docs from public documentation)
- **Memory system** — LLM Wiki pattern: ingest propagation, weekly lint, centralized index, and operation log

### Removed
- **`docs/integrations/licensing.md`** — internal only, not public
- **`docs/integrations/whatsapp.md`** — internal only, not public

### Fixed
- **Dashboard build** — removed unused `totalTokens` variable in Costs page that blocked TypeScript compilation

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Evolution API skill** (`int-evolution-api`) — 33 commands: instances, messages (text, media, location, contact, buttons, lists, polls), chats, groups, webhooks
- **Evolution Go skill** (`int-evolution-go`) — 24 commands: instances, messages, reactions, presence
- **Evo CRM skill** (`int-evo-crm`) — 48 commands: contacts, conversations, messages, inboxes, pipelines, labels
- **Integration docs** — 3 new guides: `docs/integrations/evolution-api.md`, `evolution-go.md`, `evo-crm.md`
- **Dashboard integrations** — Evolution API, Evolution Go, and Evo CRM cards on Integrations page
- **`.env.example`** — added `EVOLUTION_API_URL/KEY`, `EVOLUTION_GO_URL/KEY`, `EVO_CRM_URL/TOKEN`

### Changed
- **Integration count** — 16 → 17 across README, site, and docs (removed internal-only Licensing and WhatsApp docs)
- **Community members** — 7,000+ → 17,000+ on site
- **v0.4 roadmap complete** — all 13 items done, Evolution product skills was the last one

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- **Docs markdown rendering** — replaced regex parser with `marked` library. Code blocks, ASCII art, and nested formatting now render correctly on the site.
- **README and site** — `npx @evoapi/open-claude` is now the primary install method. Git clone shown as alternative.
- **Release skill** — `make docs-build` and frontend rebuild are now mandatory on every release (not conditional).

### Fixed
- **Site /docs navigation** — nested doc pages (e.g., `/docs/guides/creating-routines`) no longer 404. Switched from `useRoute` wildcard to direct URL parsing.
- **Site route matching** — changed from `/docs/:slug+` to `/docs/*` for reliable wouter matching.
- **CLI default directory** — `npx @evoapi/open-claude` without args now clones into current directory (`.`), not a subfolder.
- **Site CI build** — added missing `print-agents.png` to site assets.
- **Docs sync** — site now serves updated docs matching the repo (was stale).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Active agent visualization** — Claude Code hooks (`PreToolUse`, `Stop`) track agent launches in `agent-status.json`. Dashboard polls `/api/agents/active` and shows animated "RUNNING" badges on agent cards and overview.
- **Agents page redesign** — unique icons and accent colors per agent, slash command badges, memory count pills, status dots, hover glow effects.
- **Overview page redesign** — stat cards with icons and trend indicators, active agents bar, quick actions row (Morning Briefing, Chat, Costs, GitHub), improved reports and routines tables with relative timestamps.
- **Claude Code hooks** — `agent-tracker.sh` hook registered in `settings.json` for real-time agent activity tracking.
- **Project settings.json** — permissions (allow/deny rules), hooks configuration.
- **Inner-loop commands** — `/status` (workspace status) and `/review` (recent changes + next actions).
- **Default system: Claude Status** — `seed_systems()` creates Anthropic status page as default external system on first boot.
- **Public roadmap** — `ROADMAP.md` with community input via GitHub discussions.

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md split** — reduced from 263 to 128 lines. Detailed config moved to `.claude/rules/` (agents, integrations, routines, skills) — auto-loaded by Claude Code.
- **All 9 agent prompts generalized** — removed hardcoded personal references (Omie, Linear, Discord Evolution, Brazilian formats, etc.). User-specific context preserved in `_improvements.md` per agent memory folder.
- **Rules and commands translated** — all `.claude/rules/` and `.claude/commands/` files translated from Portuguese to English.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Docker Compose for dashboard** — `Dockerfile.dashboard` (multi-stage: node + python) + `docker-compose.yml` with dashboard, telegram, and runner services. `make docker-dashboard` to start.
- **Dashboard CI** — GitHub Actions workflow builds and pushes dashboard image to `ghcr.io/evolutionapi/open-claude/dashboard` on push/release
- **npm CI** — GitHub Actions workflow publishes CLI to npm on release (requires `NPM_TOKEN` secret)

### Changed
- **Sidebar reorganized** — 5 collapsible groups (Main, Operations, Data, System, Admin) with collapse state persisted in localStorage
- **Scheduler removed from docker-compose** — runs embedded in dashboard, not as separate service
- **`make docker-up` → `make docker-telegram`** — reflects that only Telegram is a separate Docker service
- **Public roadmap updated** — removed internal Future/Research section, marked completed items

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **CLI installer** — `npx @evoapi/open-claude` clones repo, checks prerequisites, installs deps, runs setup wizard, and builds dashboard
- **Version indicator in dashboard** — sidebar footer shows current version; `/api/version/check` compares against latest GitHub release with 1h cache
- **Public roadmap** — `ROADMAP.md` with 4 phases (v0.4 → Future), community input via GitHub discussions
- **Update guide** — `docs/guides/updating.md` with git pull, Docker, and custom content preservation instructions

### Changed
- **Privacy-first licensing** — removed heartbeat thread, deactivate endpoint, and shutdown hook. Only initial registration remains (who installed). No monitoring, no kill switch, no telemetry.
- **Licensing version** — now reads from `pyproject.toml` dynamically instead of hardcoded constant

### Fixed
- **nginx 403 on `/docs/`** — removed `$uri/` from `try_files` so directory paths fall through to SPA instead of returning Forbidden
- **`.gitignore` formatting** — `site/lib/` and `mempalace.yaml` were concatenated on one line
- **User-specific files removed from git** — `mempalace.yaml` and `entities.json` no longer tracked

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Docs page on site** (`/docs`) — full documentation viewer with sidebar, search, and markdown rendering
- **Auto-version system** — `pyproject.toml` is single source of truth, injected into site (Vite `__APP_VERSION__`), dashboard (`/api/version`), and CI (Docker build-arg)
- **Pre-build docs index** — `scripts/build-docs-index.mjs` generates `docs-index.json` at build time
- **`/api/version` endpoint** — dashboard serves current version from `pyproject.toml`

### Changed
- **`make docs-build`** — now also syncs `docs/` to `site/public/docs/`
- **Docs links** in landing page point to `/docs` (internal route, not dashboard)
- **Site version badge** — reads from `pyproject.toml` dynamically instead of hardcoded

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Landing page** (`site/`) — standalone React + Vite static site, extracted from Replit monorepo
- **Docker support for site** — multi-stage Dockerfile (node build → nginx serve) + docker-compose
- **GitHub Actions CI** — workflow builds site image and pushes to `ghcr.io/evolutionapi/open-claude/site` on push/release
- **Docs bundled in site image** — `docs/` copied into site build context automatically

### Changed
- **`.gitignore` updated** — site tracked in repo (Replit artifacts, node_modules, dist excluded)
- **Site assets renamed** — clean filenames (`logo.png`, `print-overview.png`, etc.) instead of Replit hashes

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Public Documentation** (`/docs`) — full docs site inside the dashboard, accessible without auth
- **MemPalace** — semantic knowledge base with ChromaDB for code/doc search (optional)
- **Content search** — docs search now matches inside file content, not just titles
- **llms-full.txt** — pre-generated plain text with all docs for LLM consumption (`/docs/llms-full.txt`)
- **23 routine examples** and **21 template examples** shipped with repo
- **14 documentation screenshots** in `docs/imgs/`
- **Comprehensive docs** — 28 markdown files across 9 sections (guides, dashboard, agents, skills, routines, integrations, real-world, reference)
- **Practical usage guides** — how to run routines, invoke agents, create custom skills

### Changed
- **Unofficial disclaimer** — README, docs, and landing page clearly state "unofficial, not affiliated with Anthropic"
- **Positioning** — "compatible with Claude Code and other LLM tooling" (not "purpose-built for")
- **Enterprise-safe language** — "integrates with" instead of "leverages", opens door for multi-provider future
- **Docs sidebar** — logical section ordering, section icons, content preview in search
- **llms-full.txt** — served as static pre-generated file (instant load, no on-the-fly concatenation)
- **i18n** — final cleanup, 18 files translated from Portuguese to English

### Fixed
- `/docs/llms-full.txt` redirect (was showing docs sidebar with "Loading..." instead of plain text)
- Screenshots with personal data removed and replaced
- 10 doc files corrected after full audit

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **Create Routine skill** (`create-routine`) — guides users through creating custom routines step by step
- **Scheduler embedded in dashboard** — runs automatically with `make dashboard-app`, no separate process
- **Core/Custom badges** — scheduled routines and templates show green "core" or gray "custom" labels
- **Custom routines from YAML** — scheduler loads custom routines dynamically from `config/routines.yaml`
- **.env editor** — edit environment variables directly from the Config page in the dashboard
- **Auto-discover reports** — Reports page scans entire `workspace/` recursively, no hardcoded paths

### Changed
- **Routines reorganized** — 4 core routines in `ADWs/routines/`, custom in `ADWs/routines/custom/` (gitignored)

### Removed
- **ROADMAP.md** from Config page (file no longer exists)
- **Docker section** from Services page
- **Specific routine schedules** from scheduler.py (moved to user's `config/routines.yaml`)
- **Custom routines from git** — 23 scripts moved to gitignored `custom/` directory
